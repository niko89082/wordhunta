messing around contains stuff that i was just messing around with. 
-instead of using yfinance i tried to use some other library
-i might switch it to the other library just because it has a news feature which could help with sentiment analysis

sentiment analysis section
-contains code from a youtube video on sentiment analysis trading
-the bot in the video did pretty well showing a 500% gain over 5 years through just trading SPY on positive and negative sentiment 
-the files for that code are finebert_util.py and tradingboy.py 
-i played around with the og code for that so it isnt the same as what it used to be but i think i can adjust it so it performs well. 
-not sure if it was doing options trading though 

NEWNEWS.py 
-this is under sentiment
-uses some online stock news site and parses through the raw html of it looking for just the article titles 
-a few sentiment analysis options
    --from flair.models import TextClassifier
        from flair.data import Sentence
    --import nltk
        from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
        nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
        import operator
    --from textblob import TextBlob

main.ibynp
-this is rivero's og code which ig he used as a foundation for his project
-he said he also used sentiment analysis but he didnt give us the code for that
-the goal is to achieve something similar to his which was (allegedly) 3000% in about 3 months.
